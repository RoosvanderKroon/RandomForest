########### practice 1 with QGIS polygons and rf classification in R ##############
# First get raster image in QGIS --> my case I used google satellite and the Raster tool to crop area of interest into raster image and ave it as .tif file
# then start making polygons of different landcover site, not too big!
# I created 11 agriculture polygons, 8 forest, and 10 field
# setwd("/media/sf_exchange/landsatdata/")
