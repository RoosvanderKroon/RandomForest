########### practice 1 with QGIS polygons and rf classification in R ##############
# First get raster image in QGIS --> my case I used google satellite and the Raster tool to crop area of interest into raster image and 
# save it as "Training_data.tif" file
# then start making polygons of different landcover site, not too big! with attribute "class"
# make sure that the shapefile and rasterfile use the same CRS!
# add classes in layer properties, symbology so see different classes
# export layer and save as shapefile
# let's go to R

library (raster)
library (ggplot2)
library (caret)
library (randomForest)
# set working directory setwd("C://your_path/.../...")

# assign rasterfile with brick function (multiple layers)
aoi <- brick("Training_data.tif")
# assign shapefile data and check if raster file and shapefile have the same CRS
datapolygons <- shapefile("landclassification2.shp")

# start plotting, first the rasterfile
plotRGB(aoi, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3, stretch = "lin")
plot(datapolygons, col= "red", add= TRUE)

# transform into factor and see classifications
levels(as.factor(datapolygons$class)

rasterdata <- extract(aoi, datapolygons, df = TRUE)
